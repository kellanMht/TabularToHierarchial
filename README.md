# TabularToHierarchial
This Java program can be used to read an excel file, and then convert that excel file to hierarchical JSON format

Steps:
You may use the codes in folder "src",.JARFiles and the dummy .xlsx file to run this program. I used Eclipse.
In Eclipse:
Step 1: Create a simple Java project in eclipse.
Step 2: Now, create a lib folder in the project.
Step 3: Download and add the following jar files in the lib folder:
commons-collections4-4.1.jar
poi-3.17.jar
poi-ooxml-3.17.jar
poi-ooxml-schemas-3.17.jar
xmlbeans-2.6.0.jar
Step 4: Set the Class Path:
Right-click on the project ->Build Path ->Add External JARs -> select all the above jar files -> Apply and close.
Step 4: Use the files (code) in "src".
Step 5: Change the "path" variable in "TabularToHierarchy.java" to the path to the dummy .xlsx file.
Step 6: Run and get the output.
